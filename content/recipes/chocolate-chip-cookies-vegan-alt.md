## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the `sugar`, `brown sugar`, `salt`, and `coconut oil` until combined.
2. Whisk in `non-dairy milk` and `vanilla`, until all sugar has dissolved and the batter is smooth.
3. Sift in the `flour` and `baking soda`, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix.
4. Fold in the `chocolate` evenly.
5. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
7. Scoop the dough with an ice cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Be sure to leave at least 2 inches of space between cookies and the edges of the pan so cookies can spread evenly.
8. Bake. First batch at 15-16 mins, all subsequent batches at 12-14 mins.
