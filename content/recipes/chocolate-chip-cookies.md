# Chocolate Chip Cookies

[Original Recipe](https://www.butterandbrioche.com/home/classic-chocolate-chip-cookies)

## Before You Begin

1. **_Make sure your butter and eggs are room temperature._**
2. Make sure you give yourself at least 30 mins to refrigerate the dough.
3. Wet ingredients (i.e. butter+sugar+egg mix) goes into the largest 6qt bowl, while dry is done in a medium bowl. When mixing, pour the dry into the wet gently as you're beating/mixing.
4. First batch should be baked for 15-16 minutes, other batches at 14 minutes due to the baking sheet being cool to start.

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat the oven at 180 C for a generous amount of time, i.e. 2hr+. You won't need all of that time for all batches, but it gives you lots of wiggle-room if you need it.
2. In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together the` all-purpose flour`, `baking powder`, `instant coffee/ espresso powder`, `baking soda`, and `salt`. Set aside.
3. Get your brown sugar in a small bowl and ensure it's not clumped together. If it is, put a damp paper towel over the bowl and microwave for 30 seconds and use a fork to break it up and fluff it.
4. In the 6qt bowl, use the hand mixer on medium to beat together the `cubed butter`, `granulated sugar`, and `brown sugar`. For about 5 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl as needed.
5. Add in the `eggs`, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pause mixing to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed.
6. Add in the `vanilla extract` and beat for a further minute, until well combined. The butter mix should should be considerably lightened in colour.
7. **Set the mixer speed to medium-low** and add in half the dry ingredients into the 6qt bowl. Beat until roughly combined, then, add in the remainder of the dry ingredients. Beat for a further 30 seconds, or until just combined.
8. Add in the roughly chopped `dark chocolate` and` chocolate chips` and beat until evenly combined.
9. Put plastic wrap on the 6qt bowl and put cookie dough in the fridge for a _minimum_ of 30 mins.
10. The oven _should_ be pre-heated by now, so line your baking sheet with non-stick parchment paper.
11. Use a small scoop to put in small 1"-ish cookie dough balls onto the baking sheet.
12. Add a couple of flakes of salt per dough ball
13. Bake the first batch at 15-16 mins, and every batch after that at 14 mins. Any unused dough can go in the fridge.
14. Remove cookies from the baking sheet as they're completed and add them to a plate to cool.
